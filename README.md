I used Transfer Learning to make this model, and it was trained in 7 drags only using the dataset in the link below

Dataset: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jcfuME1mYTWHubynDRTwkRU-q6VzRonk/view?usp=sharing
The model predicts the name of the drug among the list of drugs with an accuracy of 97.2%, and it was tested with images that are also available in
  Dataset

All he has to do is enter an image of the prescription, and the pre-processing model will remove the header and footer and cut the names of the medicines, then enter them on the model and return the name of the drug to you
